Skills are prompt-level capability modules for AgentOS. They are not runtime extensions; they teach an agent when and how to use tools, workflows, and external systems through `SKILL.md` content.

## The 3-Tier Skills Architecture

AgentOS skills are split into three public layers:

1. `@framers/agentos/skills`
   The runtime engine. This is where `SkillLoader`, `SkillRegistry`, snapshots, and path helpers live.
2. `@framers/agentos-skills`
   The curated content package. It ships `SKILL.md` files plus the generated `registry.json` index.
3. `@framers/agentos-skills-registry`
   The catalog SDK. It provides query helpers, lazy loading, and factories over the curated content package.

## Start Here

- Use [Skills (SKILL.md)](/skills/skill-format) to author and structure skills.
- Use [`@framers/agentos-skills`](/skills/agentos-skills) when you need the curated content pack.
- Use [`@framers/agentos-skills-registry`](/skills/agentos-skills-registry) when you need catalog search, lazy loading, or factories.

## Skills vs Extensions

- Extensions are runtime code: tools, guardrails, workflows, and providers.
- Skills are prompt content: they explain operating procedures, decision rules, and tool-usage patterns to the model.

Both can participate in discovery, but they solve different layers of the system.
