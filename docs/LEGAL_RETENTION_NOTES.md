# Optional retention checklist

AgentOS does not collect telemetry by default. These notes are provided as guidance if you operate a hosted deployment of the Voice Chat Assistant or similar product on top of the runtime.

- gency_usage_log **(optional)** – track agency launches only if you need metering or billing reconciliation. Many self-hosted installs can disable the table entirely.
- gentos_persona_submissions **(optional)** – queue marketplace bundles for review when you expose a public catalogue. If you self-curate personas, skip the submissions path.
- Marketplace visibility (public, unlisted, org, invite) and status (draft, pending, published, etired) are hooks for your own governance. Adjust or remove based on your business model.
- Always disclose your own retention policy to end users and implement deletion/export features that match local regulations.
