> A human-readable `.md` file that persists across conversations — inspired by Mastra's agent notepad pattern. Complements the Baddeley cognitive working memory with durable, editable state.

## Overview

Each agent maintains a markdown file at `~/.wunderland/agents/{seedId}/working-memory.md`. This file is:

- **Injected** into every prompt as a `## Persistent Memory` section
- **Updated** by the agent via tools during conversation
- **Human-editable** — open the file in any text editor to add or correct information
- **Budget-capped** at 5% of the prompt token budget to avoid context bloat

## How It Coexists with Baddeley Cognitive Memory

| Aspect | Markdown Working Memory | Baddeley Cognitive Memory |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Persistence** | Survives restarts, stored on disk | Ephemeral, lives in RAM per session |
| **Capacity** | 5% of token budget (~200-800 tokens) | 7 +/- 2 slots, personality-modulated |
| **Content** | User preferences, project context, facts | Active reasoning slots, recent stimuli |
| **Update mechanism** | Explicit tool call or manual edit | Automatic decay and activation |
| **Visibility** | Human-readable `.md` file | Internal cognitive model |
| **Purpose** | Long-term agent personalization | Short-term cognitive processing |

Both systems contribute to the prompt simultaneously — they are complementary, not competing.

## Tools

### `read_working_memory`

Returns the current contents of the agent's working memory file.

```json
{ "name": "read_working_memory" }
```

### `update_working_memory`

Replaces the entire file content. The agent decides what to keep, add, or remove.

```json
{
  "name": "update_working_memory",
  "input": {
    "content": "## User Preferences\n- Prefers concise answers\n- Timezone: PST\n\n## Current Project\n- Building a REST API with Hono\n- Database: PostgreSQL\n"
  }
}
```

## Default Template

New agents start with a minimal template:

```markdown
## User Preferences
<!-- Agent will fill in learned preferences -->

## Current Project
<!-- Context about what the user is working on -->

## Key Facts
<!-- Important information to remember across sessions -->
```

## Custom Templates

Override the default via `agent.config.json`:

```json
{
  "workingMemoryTemplate": "## Client Profile\n\n## Open Tasks\n\n## Decisions Log\n"
}
```

## Prompt Injection

On every turn, `PromptBuilder` reads the file and injects it:

```
## Persistent Memory
<contents of working-memory.md>
```

The section is capped at 5% of the total prompt token budget. If the file exceeds this limit, it is truncated with a warning appended to the prompt.

## Manual Editing

The file is plain markdown — edit it anytime:

```bash
# Open in your editor
vim ~/.wunderland/agents/my-agent/working-memory.md
```

Changes are picked up on the next conversation turn with no restart required.
