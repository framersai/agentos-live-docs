Defined in: [packages/agentos/src/channels/telephony/types.ts:124](https://github.com/framersai/agentos/blob/563be3fc675f9de928227b5191763fc5aa7da9e9/src/channels/telephony/types.ts#L124)

The state machine allows free transitions between these two states so that
the agent can alternate between speaking and listening without violating
monotonic ordering.
