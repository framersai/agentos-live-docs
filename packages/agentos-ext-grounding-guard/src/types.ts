/**

 * @description Core type definitions for the Grounding Guard extension pack.
 *
 * This module defines all shared types, interfaces, and service-identity
 * constants used throughout the grounding verification pipeline.  The
 * grounding guard checks whether factual claims in agent output are
 * supported, contradicted, or unverifiable against retrieved source
 * chunks (RAG context).
