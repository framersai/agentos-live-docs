# Frame.dev

AI infrastructure for adaptive intelligence and denoising the web.

## Mission

Frame.dev builds foundational infrastructure that enables AI systems to interact with knowledge in new ways. The platform focuses on adaptive AI intelligence that is emergent and permanent.

## Vision

Creating infrastructure where:
- Knowledge becomes universally accessible through AI
- AI systems amplify rather than replace human capabilities  
- Personal knowledge management adapts to individual thinking patterns
- Open infrastructure enables innovation

## Current Products

### Frame Codex
Knowledge repository designed for LLM consumption. Open-source, structured collection of information organized into weaves, looms, and strands.

### OpenStrand
AI-native personal knowledge management system. Local-first architecture with cloud sync capabilities, knowledge graph visualization, and multi-format import.

### Frame OS (Planned)
Infrastructure for AI agents including secure execution, resource management, and deployment tools.

## Technical Philosophy

### Open Source First
Core infrastructure is open source, enabling developers to build on the foundation.

### Local-First Architecture
Privacy and data ownership through offline-first design with optional cloud synchronization.

### AI-Native Design
Built specifically for AI integration rather than retrofitted. Design decisions prioritize AI system interaction.

### Standards-Based
Embraces open standards and protocols to ensure interoperability.
